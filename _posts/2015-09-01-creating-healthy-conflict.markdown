Conflict resolution is a popular topic -- everyone has encountered difficult situations and combative people. Yet for every person I have observed causing too much conflict, I have observed nine people who *don't cause enough conflict.* 

This sounds strange to say, as most of us have been conditioned to avoid conflict whenever possible -- **and that's the problem.**

The ability to both initiate and resolve conflict is a critical life skill to building healthy relationships and teams. Without it, passive-aggressive behaviors and silent dissent quietly corrode connections until they "suddenly" collapse. When this happens teams fall apart, people leave, and projects fail.

Join me as we explore conflict and answer these questions:

* How can I confront a colleague about something without it coming across as an attack? 
* How do I improve my receptiveness to conflicting ideas? 
* What can we do to engage in healthy conflict, rather than avoid it? 
* How do we build team environments where constructive conflict is regular and encouraged?
