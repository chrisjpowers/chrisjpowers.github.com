Lately I've been thinking about how individuals within teams and organizations relate to one another, how they interact and interconnect.
Regardless of their particular roles, knowledge workers are expected to offer ["customer service"](/blog/customer-service-for-developers) to their colleagues and the organization as a whole.
The dependency graph between teams and divisions quickly grows into a complex network, and the level of service we provide each other has real impact on efficiency and profit.

We each have our own sense of morality by which we judge how we should treat the people we encounter every day.
Yet given the high stakes and the tangible benefits of shared expectations, I wondered what an organizational moral system could look like.
Outside of religion, outside of cultural tradition, could we find a moral system to measure and align the interactions between diverse employees across an organization?

Immediately my mind went towards the oldest, most ubiquitous moral system I could think of: **the Golden Rule**.

While many people would cite the Golden Rule as a biblical idea, its cultural pervasiveness struck me as far more universal than any particular religious tradition.
The Golden Rule feels like a piece of Americana, sandwiched between a baseball game and a slice of apple pie.
This ubiquity is both the strength and weakness of the mantra -- while it feels immediately accessible, the familiarity breeds contempt.
We are more likely to think of the Golden Rule as a kindergarden lesson than a code by which to navigate our complicated adult world.

How did we get here? Has the Golden Rule always been regarded as pass√©, or did it once have teeth?

As I explored the history of the phrase, I was surprised both by how old the idea is, as well as the various manifestations it has taken over time.

If you think back to high school history, you'll probably recall Hammurabi's Code.
