What does it mean to "be right"? Why is "being right" so important to us? Can "rightness" be measured? How do we handle differences in opinion? When you know you're right, but your team doesn't agree, what then? When is "being right" the wrong thing for your team?

As an engineering manager at Groupon, I have seen first-hand the way that someone "being right" can hurt working relationships, poison teams and ruin projects. In this talk, we will explore how we think and act about being right, learn about tools that ease the task of finding consensus in a group, and walk away with actionable steps towards improving our teams and organizations.
