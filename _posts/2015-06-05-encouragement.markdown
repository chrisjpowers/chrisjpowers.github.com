Mark Twain said, "I can last two months on a good compliment." Postive feedback and encouragement have enormous impact on us; it helps us feel appreciated, connected, and inspires us toward peak performance. Sadly it is severely under-utilized, as tech workers regularly cite feeling unappreciated as the primary motivator to change jobs.

Encouragement is a "super power" we each have, yet like any skill we must develop it. Once we do, we will change the lives of the people around us.

This talk is for anyone that wants to make significant, positive impact in their organization. In it, we will discuss:

* The key differences between acknowledgement, appreciation, praise, and encouragement (they're not synonyms!).
* The fears and forces that keep us from using encouragement, and the steps to overcome them.
* A practical framework for giving sincere encouragement, regardless of your role.
* Realistic strategies you can immediately use to unlock and unleash your power of encouragement.
