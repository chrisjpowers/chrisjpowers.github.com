*Part of the [Reflections on That Conference 2013](/blog/reflections-on-that-conference-2013) series.*

One thing [That Conf](http://www.thatconference.com) has consistently offered
its attendees is a dizzyingly
large array of talks to choose from. Every hour, there are between 7 and 10
speakers sharing their expertise and passion, and you can only pick one!
The organizers do a great job of ensuring each speaker is covering something
different -- open source, Microsoft, Web, cloud, desktop, mobile, frontend,
backend, soft talks, tech talks, the list goes on. And still, I was torn
between multiple talks every hour.

Given that, you can understand my initial doubt that an
[Open Space](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/OpenSpace.html) room would ever work.

<!-- more -->

If you're not familiar with Open Spaces (I've heard it called "Birds of a
Feather" sessions elsewhere), it's a "conference-within-a-conference"
where attendees lead ad-hoc sessions inside a communal space. A large
white board maintains a grid of time slots and locations, and attendees
are free to write their topic on a Post-It and use it to claim their slot.

You never know how many people will attend your open space, nor how
many of them will actually stay. The "two feet" principle encourages
attendees to get up and leave if they are not getting or giving value
in the group they are in. Between the 10 scheduled sessions, 4 open
spaces sessions, a hallway full of vendors hocking merch and a room
dedicated for games of [Artemis](htp://www.artemis.eochu.com)...
well, there's a lot of competition for an attendee's attention.

Last year I wanted to help Microsofty guys get up and running with Node.js
and figured this was a good format for it. I slapped my Post-It
note on the board and figured a couple people would be interested.
Sure enough, 3 people came by and I helped them get a "hello world"
up on their PCs (an experience which warrants its own article).

## Shifting Gears

This year my mind was in a different place. Having shifted into an
engineering manager role at Groupon at the beginning of the year,
I'm still actively trying to figure out what the heck I'm doing.
Figuring there were managers at the conference with a wealth of
experience, I selfishly scheduled an Open Spaces discussion called
"Engineering Management: How can we do better?".

I expected 2 or 3 people again, so you can imagine my surprise
as I fetched more chairs for the 20+ people that showed up!
Everyone that attended was an engineering manager with a wide
variety of experience. One guy had been promoted to manager just
days before the conference, others had been doing this for years
and years. As if that weren't great enough, author and Lean Software
Development guru [Mary Poppendieck](http://www.poppendieck.com)
joined the discussion as well.

I got the discussion started and then promptly shut up as I tried
to get all the group's ideas up on the enormous PostIt note pad
in front of me. We talked about the challenges of transitioning
from developer to manager, and the forces (both from other people
and ourselves) that pushed us back towards our developer ways.
We talked about coaching our direct reports, and how many of us
spent so little time doing it. We talked about the difficulties
of setting project goals and timelines, of maintaining agile
practices amidst waterfall expectations.

## Common Themes

To be honest, much of what was discussed has already faded from
memory, but a few ideas stuck with me:

1. Many of us are unsure of what we're supposed to be doing and
suffer from having little to no direction, but we're trying our best.

2. Many of us constantly feel a gravitational pull yanking us back
towards doing development work, and we're not sure what's best to do.

3. Many of us feel like we're missing a community, that we have to
figure out our problems by ourselves.

4. We're all on the hunt for resources that can give us both ideas
and feedback about how we approach management.

I'm going to write more about each of these themes, but for now I'll
just admit that I was thrilled to not be alone in these concerns!
Each of these has plagued me, and here I am, not saying a word, but
hearing thoughts akin to my own being shared by this group of people.

As our hour came to a close (though the conversation had not)
I walked away knowing that I was not alone, but also that these
conversations don't just start by themselves. That has been my
impetus for sitting back down and blogging again, to do what I can
to stir up the conversations I long to be a part of.

I have very few answers, but I never intended to give you
answers. Let's get the questions out there, all out in the open.
The questions we're ashamed of, the questions that make us doubt
ourselves, the questions that we silently and shamefully share
without even knowing it.

Let's start there and work out the answers together.
