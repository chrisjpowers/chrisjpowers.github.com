JavaScript has quickly climbed in popularity, claiming large parts of codebases thanks to the power of Node.js, React, Angular, and Ember. Unfortunately developers regularly struggle writing high-quality JavaScript code in the fast-paced environment of front-end product development. Refactoring JS is not a “nice to have,” it’s a necessity!

<!-- more -->

This hour will be dedicated to demonstrating refactoring techniques in browser JavaScript code. The coding will be live, mistakes will probably be made, but the code will get cleaner!

During this live coding session we will touch on:

* Applying the 4 Rules of Simple Code
* Using the SOLID principles
* Improving the clarity and legibility of the code
* Weighing the costs of changing code vs. not changing it

Come join the fun and step up your refactoring skills!
