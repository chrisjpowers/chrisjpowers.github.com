How do you feel about Test Driven Development? Chances are, it’s a love-hate relationship. Sure, you love the idea and the benefits it espouses, but when your fingers hit the keyboard it never lives up to the hype.

Effective TDD takes a very particular mindset, and personally I never discovered that from books and screencasts. It wasn’t until I paired with developers who could clearly communicate their testing thought patterns that the light went on. So take this opportunity to “pair” with me!

This session will be an hour of TDD-powered live coding. We will iteratively work through the design, testing, and implementation of a feature, discussing the choices we make along the way. We’ll talk about how to “TDD like you mean it”, using the tests to shape how we approach our development workflow and our relationship to requirements.
