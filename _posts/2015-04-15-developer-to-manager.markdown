We have all read blog articles from developers-turned-managers-turned-developers again decrying the shift while warning others not to "sell out" and stop writing code. The transition from software engineer to engineering manager is difficult, confusing, and disorienting, and it's no wonder -- this isn't a promotion, it's a career change!

For some developers, the management track is a disastrous fit, while others come alive in the new role. It all comes down to motivations: What are the things you value? How do you add value to your organization every day? When you are building software, what parts of the process are most compelling to you?

This talk is for developers who might be considering becoming managers, who have already become managers, or who want to confirm that management is not for them! After this talk, you will have learned about:

* The differences between how developers and managers contribute value to their organizations.

* The motivations that drive us towards building code, versus building teams.

* Practical tools for identifying your motivations and discovering the alignment between your motivations, your role, your team, and your organization.

* Clear indications of when management is not the right path for you.
