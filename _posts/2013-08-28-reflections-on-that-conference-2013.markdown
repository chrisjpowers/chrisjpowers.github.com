I like [That Conference](http://www.thatconference.com). It's a young conference; this August
was only its second occurrence, and I've had the privilege to speak at both. It's hosted at
the Kalahari Resort in the Wisconsin Dells, one of these enormous hotels that boasts both an
exterior *and* interior [water park](/blog/the-waterpark). The conference has always been family
friendly (hence the location), so I've enjoyed bringing my wife and daughter with me. I
certainly look forward to when my daughter is old enough to attend the Lego Mindstorm
kid programming sessions! She's only a year and a half old, though, so in the meantime she's
building quite a proficiency in pool splashing.

While I enjoy the family atmosphere and the focus on bolstering tech in the Midwest, the thing
that impresses me most about the conference is the vision and heart of the organizers. The
passion they exude is abundant, and the fortitude it takes to build an event like this
as volunteers is worthy of applause.

One of the overarching themes that [Clark Sell](http://csell.net/) made clear throughout the
conference was that this was *our* conference. The organizers had set the stage, but ultimately
the success of the conference was in our hands. What would we learn? Who would we engage?
How would we [challenge our own views](/blog/jumping-off-the-bandwagon)? Look at our
coworkers and colleagues [in a different light](/blog/the-waterpark)? Would we break out of
our comfortable lectures to have discussions in the [Open Space](/blog/an-open-space) room?

I've heard challenges like this at the beginnings of other conferences, but something about
this time rang true. The organizers are hackers like us. They had been engaging in the
creative process for the last year, but the end product was not meant to be static. They
started the conversation, but we had to continue it. The conference wasn't perfect, but
we had been given the opportunities to contribute, to make it better. Speakers, attendees,
organizers, sponsors, we were all building an environment together.

Perhaps this is why I came away from this conference with many more thoughts and experiences
to share that at other conferences. I'll be sharing them here in following articles as a small
contribution back to the community. When That Conference 2014 arrives, I will be excited
to once again participate in this living environment and push our Midwest development
community forward, one conversation at a time.
